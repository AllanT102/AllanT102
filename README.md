Hi! I'm Allan 😁

I'm currently in my final year of computer science studies at the University of British Columbia. 

Some things I've done in the past...
- Owned multiple full-stack features on the AIP Agent Studio team at Palantir Technologies
- Led a team of developers at UBC BizTech to launch features for 1000+ students
- Spearheaded my own product hackathon!

I'll be graduating May 2026, and I'm looking for new grad opportunities. I'm interested in backend, infrastructure, product, and full-stack roles.
