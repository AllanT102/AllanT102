[Looking for Fall 2023 && Summer 2024 Internships!]

Hi! 👋 I'm Allan, a third-year Computer Science student at UBC. I am an aspiring software engineer and avid learner who enjoys solving challenging problems and seeks personal growth. I have interests in fullstack software engineering, AI/ML, databases, data engineering, and distributed systems. 💻🧠

I have experience with full stack web development through my internship at CoPilot AI (C#, Azure, TypeScript) and other projects that I have worked on (React, Node, SQL, NoSQL, MongoDB, Java). 

Just recently, I had the amazing opportunity to direct Western Canada's only product-focused hackathon, where we created some incredible software products. This experience taught me the importance of collaboration and leadership! 🚀

When I'm not coding, you'll find me on the basketball court, shooting hoops and enjoying the game. 🏀

Please feel free to reach out and connect!
