Hi, I'm a Computer Science student @ UBC graduating in 2026. I have 8 months of internship experience, and I'll be heading into my 3rd work term this summer @ Citi :)

Interests: Backend, Full-stack, Infrastructure, Distributed Systems

Me :

- I find opportunities to take initiative, solve challenging problems, and learn proactively

- I learn quickly because I'm passionate about software engineering :D

- Being a hackathon director has taught me key communication skills and how to collaborate cross-functionally to build a product that brings value to the community

- I interned on the platform team at CoPilot AI where I was able to create meaningful impact on stakeholders while using C#, Azure, TypeScript

- I am a 3x hackathon winner (nwHacks, HackCamp, Hack the Change) where I built full stack applications using Node.js, Express.js, JavaScript, Python, Flask, React.js

I'd love to connect with you via LinkedIn or email allantan.zf@gmail.com.
